The Hacker Playbook 2
http://www.amazon.com/dp/1512214566/

Since this book is based off of the Kali Linux platform, you can download the Kali Linux distro from: http://www.kali.org/downloads/. I highly recommend you download the VMware image (https://www.offensive-security.com/kali-linux-vmware-arm-image-download/) and download Virtual Player/VirtualBox. Remember that it will be a gz-compressed and tar archived file, so make sure to extract them first and load the vmx file.

Once Your Kali VM is Up and Running
●	Log in with the username root and the default password toor
●	Open a terminal
●	Change the password
	○	passwd
●	Update the image
	○	apt-get update
	○	apt-get dist-upgrade
●	Setup Metasploit database
	○	service postgresql start
	○	msfdb init
●	Make postgresql database start on boot
	○	update-rc.d postgresql enable
●	Install gedit
	○	apt-get install gedit
●	Change the hostname - Many network admins look for systems named Kali in logs like DHCP. It is best to follow the naming standard used by the company you are testing
	○	gedit /etc/hostname
		■	Change the hostname (replace kali) and save
	○	gedit /etc/hosts
		■	Change the hostname (replace kali) and save
	○	reboot
●	*Optional for Metasploit - Enable Logging
	○	I list this as optional since logs get pretty big, but you have the ability to log every command and result from Metasploit’s Command Line Interface (CLI). This becomes very useful for bulk attack/queries or if your client requires these logs. *If this is a fresh image, type msfconsole first and exit before configuring logging to create the .msf4 folder.
	○	From a command prompt, type:
		■	echo "spool /root/msf_console.log" > /root/.msf4/msfconsole.rc
	○	Logs will be stored at /root/msf_console.log
